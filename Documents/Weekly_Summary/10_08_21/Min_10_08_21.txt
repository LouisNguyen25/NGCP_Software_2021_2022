Summary:
I continued to research the implementation methods and example codes of the IMU part( MPU-6500) and Communication part (Digi XBS2C). Starting with the MPU-6500, I already found links that will help with the implementation for both Raspberry pi and Ardunio last week, thus I focused on searching for the implementation methods for Digi XBS2C. I found two more websites each that demonstrated how to connect with Raspberry pi and Arduino. 
Complications:
There wasn’t a lot of information about connecting with the MPU-6500, so I had to look for other models that have a similar implementation. 
Next Actions:
Compare the documents and make notes of which one is better to use.
