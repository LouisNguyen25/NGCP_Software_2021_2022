Researched tutorials on implementing motor and encoder
	Found Arduino and Raspberry Pi Tutorials for setting up L298N motor controller.
		- Tutorials seemed simple to implement
		- However, I did not see a port to plug in the encoder, only the motor.
		- Need to look into it further, we may need a different controller or a separate
		  module to hook up the encoder.
		- Pololu, manufacturer of our motor, has a list of motor controllers they also make:
