Started translating Oscar's DELTA.ino file into python for use on the RPI.
The ino file is currently used to get the encoder values from the motor on the arduino
and calculate the RPM value from it.

Translation is almost done, but need to find a substitue for the TimerOne module used.
TimerOne creates an interrupt based on when the input in the speed sensor pin changes
