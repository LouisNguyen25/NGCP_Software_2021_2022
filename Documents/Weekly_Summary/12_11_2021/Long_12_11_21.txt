- Achievements: Researched the Adafruit 9-DOF Absolute Orientation IMU Fusion Breakout - BN0055. Furthermore, I tried to connect the raspberry pi to my pc.
- Plans: I plan to do more research on the Adafrui-9DOF and other IMU that are pricy and easy to implement.
- Potential Challenges: I need to know how to print out the outputs of the sensors from the IMU using a raspberry pi.
- Opportunities: I had the opportunity to work with raspberry pi and know more about it.
