Achievements: List your accomplishments during the week, including activities you’ve completed and objective you’ve met.
- I was able to understand how the RPM reading from the encoder would work
- Read some of the motor documentation and some other resources regarding PWM
- Tried to help Raphael by sending him some code and resources regarding communication with the encoder

Plans: State your specific, targeted plans for next week. Include due dates.
- Hopefully, we will implement some code next week and see if we can communicate with the encoder and read RPM and direction of the rotation

Potential Challenges: Describe any potential obstacles.
- Not having the hardware in hand is the biggest challenge for me as I cannot test the code immediately

Opportunities: Record any lessons you’ve learned and note areas where you can improve.
- Had the opportunity to dig deeper and know how PWM, pulses, and the rotation work
