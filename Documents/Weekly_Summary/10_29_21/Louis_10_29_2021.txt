Achievements: List your accomplishments during the week, including activities you’ve completed and objective you’ve met.
- Architecture of project seems to be finalizing, FPGA/Pi dual interface seems to be okay and viable according to Boskovich
- Researched with new control members in finding a way to send data from Simulink to MATLAB app then to Webots

Plans: State your specific, targeted plans for next week. Include due dates.
- One whole month for testing of prototypes, algorithms, and simulations
- Before PDR we need to check the viability of all the ideas we have in mind

Potential Challenges: Describe any potential obstacles.
- Will have to reschedule meeting times to meet up with James and Nhan on Fridays

Opportunities: Record any lessons you've learned and note areas where you can improve.
- Concurred with Boskovich to learn more about the architecture and viability of ROS network
  - Stated ROS network is a little too complicated for this project (better for multi-user interfaces)
  - Because of this we will use thie remaining month as research time into whether Simulink embedded coder is the better solution or is ROS network the way
    - Hard testing between the two is a requirement
