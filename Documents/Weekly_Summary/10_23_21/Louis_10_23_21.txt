Achievements: List your accomplishments during the week, including activities you’ve completed and objective you’ve met.
- Was able to get a little test run of a ROS network on Simulink
- Some development into getting ROS downloaded on Ubuntu and getting a Webots ROS node to run
- Teams are making progress with components 
  - GPS, IMU are at the stage of testing components for margin of error and accuracy
  - Camera has made some progress into the object detection algorithm using Yolo v5 with a training sample of 100 pets (lasted for 2 hours)
  - Ultrasonic sensor measurements made - Max of around 1015cm
    - Also would display max distance if signal bounced at an angle and did was not receieved
  - Xbee development and testing has be given to Long as Jonathan has not come through
    - Jonathan will deliver parts to Long, and will be relegated to helping with the code aspect
      - If failure to produce results or complaints raised from Long or Min, I will consider dropping him

Plans: State your specific, targeted plans for next week. Include due dates.
- Working ROS implementation on Simulink and Webots (separately) expected in the next two weeks
- Want to be able to get ROS working independetly before we start live connection tests 
- Will begin working with testing Webots models for Corey's CAD models in about 2-3 weeks time

Potential Challenges: Describe any potential obstacles.
- Lack of information related to ROS with Webots and Simulink (ROS normally used with other simulators like Gazebo)
- Can Xbee be tested with only one pi? Can it work between a computer and pi? The question still stands

Opportunities: Record any lessons you’ve learned and note areas where you can improve.
- Recruitment of new members puts the team at 12 members (not including myself)
- The knowledge of the new members in Controls will greatly help with learning how to correctly utilize Simulink graphical interfaces as a way for live paramter testing
