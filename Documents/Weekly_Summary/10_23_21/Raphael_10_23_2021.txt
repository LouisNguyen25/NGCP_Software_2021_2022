Finished set up of ultrasonic sensor on Raspberry Pi
	- Able to read distance in cm and inches fairly accurately.
	- However, when there's plenty of movement in front of the sensor, readings
	tend to be far off.
	- When facing objects at an angle, the sensor thinks the object is farther away than 
	it actually is.
	- Need to figure out how to approach this misreadings
	
Began setting up L298N motor driver and out motor/encoder on RPI
	- Still having issues on wiring, may need bigger gauge wires.
	- Will be getting a better voltage supply next week.
