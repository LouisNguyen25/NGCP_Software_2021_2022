To use the training to see if we can accuarelly detect objects that we have trained our machince to use. 

Potential Challenges: Describe any potential obstacles.
While training we need to make sure that the sample size we are using is large enought to arrcuately get results, but the larger the sample size the longer it takes to fully train.
Opportunities: Record any lessons you've learned and note areas where you can improve.
Finding the sample sizes takes a lot of time, there are websites that provide basic sample sizes ready to use for future training
