- Achievements:
- Group 0, 1, and 4 have demonstrated that they will/already have something working for the Dec. 20th demo for Arduino
- Teams working to move all their Arduino prototypes to fully RPI implementations

- Plans: 
- Later introduce to team how the Pentalinux setup will work for running Python code on FPGA

- Potential Challenges: 
- Simulink with small pulse generators affects the timing of the entire simulation, slowing it down

- Opportunities: 
- Simulink capable of interfacing with video, GPIO pins through various communication protocols, however the timing must be right to get the data from each
