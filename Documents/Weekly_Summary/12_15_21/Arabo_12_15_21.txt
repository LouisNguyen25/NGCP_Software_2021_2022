Achievements
- I was able to translate part of the code written for Arduino to python so we can use it in RPi and so the result was a successful reading of RPM and directions from RPi
- Me and Raphael had some progress translating Oscar's code to python

Plans
- Work on the translation process for Oscar's code
- Get my code to do all the things it is supposed to do (fully translate it to python from C)

Potential Challenges
- The new timer for python needs to be figured out and implemented correctly in the code
