Achievements: List your accomplishments during the week, including activities you’ve completed and objective you’ve met.
- Program loads when the sensors are enabled

Plans: State your specific, targeted plans for next week. Include due dates.
- Interface with the robot simulation to colect data from simulated sensors 

Potential Challenges: Describe any potential obstacles.
- Trying to find out why why Webots is running so slow is proving to be difficult.
- Implementing a variable that is separate with the hardware might be more difficult than expected (ie. sensor values)
- Plumbing issues arose, so finding time this week to work on this will be difficult

Opportunities: Record any lessons you’ve learned and note areas where you can improve.
- I could have put aside more time to work on the simulation, especially since it takes so long to load
