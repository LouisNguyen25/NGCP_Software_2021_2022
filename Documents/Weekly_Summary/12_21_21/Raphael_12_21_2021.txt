Continued working on encoder code for the motor on the Raspberry Pi.
Code compiles, but does not output any data, even though the motor is spinning.
Additionally, we get traceback errors from the threading module.

Arabo and myself are looking into developing our own python code instead of translating Oscar's
arduino code to python so that we have a better understanding of the code functionality.

Additionally, I created a demonstration video for the ultrasonic sensor ton the raspberry pi
