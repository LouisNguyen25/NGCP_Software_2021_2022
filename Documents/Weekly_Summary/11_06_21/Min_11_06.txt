Achievements:
-Worked on the calibratation and compass heading for the magnetometer. Started learning about the connection between a FPGA and Raspberry Pi using Serial connection(SPI).
Issues: 
-determining and editing the formula/values for the magnetometer and altitude has been diffifult. Need more research and testing.
Next step:
-Continue to research how to get the wanted values from the altitude and magnetometer.
-Also continue research on how to get, read, seperate, etc. values on the Raspberry pi.
