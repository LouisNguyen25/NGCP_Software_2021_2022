Achievements: List your accomplishments during the week, including activities you’ve completed and objective you’ve met.
- Sucessfully controlled the Kuka Youbot simulation in Webots using a Playstation 4 controller

Plans: State your specific, targeted plans for next week. Include due dates.
- Apply what I learned in setting up the Youbot simulation to apply to a different robot simulation

Potential Challenges: Describe any potential obstacles.
- I am not familiar with how Webots works, so variable names and debugging will be tougher
- Troubleshooting the Youbot took a bit of time, so I think trying to troubleshoot the other robot would be even more time consuming

Opportunities: Record any lessons you’ve learned and note areas where you can improve.
- Learned how to interface Webots with Simulink
- I should learn how to use Webots so that I can implement Matlab and Simulink more effectively
