- 

Plans: State your specific, targeted plans for next week. Include due dates.
- To find a better GPS module because the old one is very inaccurate in term of measuring the distance
- The plan is our team will buy the new GPS module and replace the old one with the Xbee module 

Potential Challenges: Describe any potential obstacles.
- The connection of the Xbee module seems very hard to implement or configure it 

Opportunities: Record any lessons you've learned and note areas where you can improve.
- I need to research more about Xbee module and how to use it to communicate with the car
