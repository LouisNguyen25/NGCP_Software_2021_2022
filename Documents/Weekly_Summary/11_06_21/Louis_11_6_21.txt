Achievements: List your accomplishments during the week, including activities you’ve completed and objective you’ve met.
- Simulink fully working and connected to Webots
- Able to test using Slider and Game Controller Inputs as a way to change direction of wheels and PWM duty cycle
- Conveyed to GCS the need for them to send preciese float values in order to accurately control Ackerman UGV (they wanted to send boolean)

Plans: State your specific, targeted plans for next week. Include due dates.
- Will get started on fully transfering Corey's Rescue Model to Webots
- Give assignment to controls group on testing Simulink with an Ackerman model in Webots
- Get images of test model for testing purposes for software and embedded to develop object classification on

Potential Challenges: Describe any potential obstacles.
- Group 4 very behind on work accomplished, hoping this week they can begin working with cameras and have deliverables by the end of the month

Opportunities: Record any lessons you've learned and note areas where you can improve.
- Is it possible to record data sent to Webots and import to hardware like we do for rosbag in a ROS network?
