Achievements: List your accomplishments during the week, including activities you’ve completed and objective you’ve met.
- Learned that we may need to label the dataset (ideally of size 1000) by ourselves for object detection in the future.
- Learned that it's more complicated to use yolo.weights file in other OS (like Windows) other than Linux.

Plans: State your specific, targeted plans for next week. Include due dates.
- Find ways to use yolo.weights file or how to use a pre-trained model in a different machine.
- Determine if .weights files are what we are looking for or if we need a different file to use/ test our trained model.

Potential Challenges: Describe any potential obstacles.
- We primarily use Windows for most of our stuff so now we have to see how to use yolo.weights file in our RPi (Linux).

Opportunities: Record any lessons you've learned and note areas where you can improve.
- Need to be more comfortable on working with Linux (RPi) to test YOLO's object detection/ recognition.
