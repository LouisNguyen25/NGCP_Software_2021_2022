Achievements: List your accomplishments during the week, including activities you’ve completed and objective you’ve met.
- Was able to get the motor running using the driver and an Arduino
- Looked up some code to be able to read encoder info

Plans: State your specific, targeted plans for next week. Include due dates.
- Further research regarding the encoder and outputting meaningful RPM info

Potential Challenges: Describe any potential obstacles.
- One challenge is to program the Arduino so it can count all 32 pulses from each output (A and B) of the encoder and convert it to RPM

Opportunities: Record any lessons you’ve learned and note areas where you can improve.
- Learned how to connect the driver with motor and Arduino and make them communicate and also communicate with the encoder
