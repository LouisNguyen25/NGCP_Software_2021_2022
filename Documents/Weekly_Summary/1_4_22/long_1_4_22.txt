- Plans: To do research on the Xbee and get it to receive information using the Raspberry Pi.
- Potential Challenges: How to modify and manipulate the print out variables. Also, to get the Xbee recieve some information using the Raspberry Pi.
- Opportunities: I had the opportunity to work with Arduino Software, Raspberry Pi, and with a partner remotely.
