Achievements: List your accomplishments during the week, including activities you’ve completed and objective you’ve met.
- Sucessfully controlled the Saeon Altino simulation in Webots using a Playstation 4 controller
  - steering returns to a neutral position when not steering

Plans: State your specific, targeted plans for next week. Include due dates.
- Interface with the robot simulation to colect data from simulated sensors by next Saturday

Potential Challenges: Describe any potential obstacles.
- I am not familiar with how Webots works, so variable names and debugging will be tougher
- Troubleshooting the Youbot took a bit of time, so I think trying to troubleshoot the other robot would be even more time consuming

Opportunities: Record any lessons you’ve learned and note areas where you can improve.
- I could tune the current simulation more so that the simulation feels better to use, but I don't know if that would be a productive use of time if 
  making sure the simulation works is our current objective
  - I could also implement accurate Ackerman steering
- I learned to read the documentation a bit more carefully; lots of debugging efforts were caused by naming conflicts
