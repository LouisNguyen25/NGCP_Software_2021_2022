Achievements: List your accomplishments during the week, including activities you’ve completed and objective you’ve met.
- Team members are getting parts and programs ready for testing the camera.
- One of our team members successfully set up the RPi and streamed it.

Plans: State your specific, targeted plans for next week. Include due dates.
- Finish setting up OpenCV on RPi to be able to find latency and fps readings of the camera feed.

Potential Challenges: Describe any potential obstacles.
- Not all members in our team have the necessary parts yet.
- In the future when we're ready to test, we will need a dataset of the hiker images to use YOLO to learn to detect them.
However, this data set is specific and we may need to create them by ourselves. It is tedious and time consuming because we will need at least 1000 images.

Opportunities: Record any lessons you've learned and note areas where you can improve.
- RPi Camera v2 quality is good and no latency so far as we tested streaming it.
