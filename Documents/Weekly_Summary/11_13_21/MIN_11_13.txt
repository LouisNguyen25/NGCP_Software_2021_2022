Accomplishment:
- Researched for a new IMU--> MPU 6050
- Watched videos of how to implement the IMU and wrote the documentation for it.
- Found 2 github resources that will be helpful during the actual implementation
- Why we switched?
	The original IMU had problems with calibration of the magnetometer and 	alitmeter.
Next Step:
-Actually implement the IMU and interface using Ardunio.
