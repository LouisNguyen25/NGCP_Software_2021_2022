Achievements: List your accomplishments during the week, including activities you’ve completed and objective you’ve met.
- Enable easy file transferring between RPi and Windows through SSH and WinSCP

Plans: State your specific, targeted plans for next week. Include due dates.
- Finish setting up OpenCV on RPi to be able to find latency and fps readings of the camera feed.
- Look for ways to expand RPi's wifi range, maybe through a USB Module Antenna for RPi
- Team members get the working doll and proceed to take pictures and create dataset for YOLO training.

Potential Challenges: Describe any potential obstacles.
- Not all members in our team have the necessary parts yet.
- We will have to create our own dataset with the doll. Ideally, we need the dataset of size 1000, but we will try to do at least 100.

Opportunities: Record any lessons you've learned and note areas where you can improve.
- Using the trained weights file is still a learning process. I may need to find a different tutorial to train and maybe find a different approach to use the trained dataset.
