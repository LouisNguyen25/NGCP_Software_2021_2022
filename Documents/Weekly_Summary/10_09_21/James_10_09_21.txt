For this week, my team found many source for the GPS components, source code that relates to the Webot Simulation:
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4J159jfjG8&ab_channel=Softillusion: Full tutorial with using C++ to intergrate GPS with a custom robot
    - Step to create GPS by using Webot simulation:
        1. Creating the shape for GPS
        2. Choosing the library function (GPS) for the robot
        3. Creating distancesensor, motor, robot, keyboard, gps functions
        4. Writing GPS function for the robot
    - Libray functions code for it: 
        #include <webots/DistanceSensor.hpp>
        #include <webots/Motor.hpp>
        #include <webots/Robot.hpp>
        #include <webots/Keyboard.hpp>
        #include <webots/GPS.hpp>
