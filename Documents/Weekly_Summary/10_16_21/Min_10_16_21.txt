Accomplishment:
Joint-meeting:
-worked on the documentation for the IMU
        - researched what the IMU is and how to implement it
Software meeting:
-implemented the magnetometer
-implemented to the altimeter/barometer


Issue:
- the altitude value from altimeter seems inaccurate


Next Step:
- convert the magnetometer data to compass heading
-double check the conversion on the altimeter
