- Find an alternative camera to work with Raspberry Pi 4
- More research on YOLO Detection
- Finish setting up OpenCV on Raspberry Pi
- Final decision on whether to get Raspberry Pi Camera V2 and find more tech specs on it

Potential Challenges: Describe any potential obstacles.
- Find an affordable but good quality camera that can be used with Raspberry Pi
- Setting up OpenCV takes a lot of time
- Finding and deciding new camera (+ camera's info) to buy, consider the price and delivery date

Opportunities: Record any lessons you've learned and note areas where you can improve.
- Found that PCam5C has OV5640 sensor, but Raspberry Pi only supports the OV5657 and Sony IMX219 sensors. We need to get a different camera.
- There are 2 good cameras: Raspberry Pi Camera Module V2 and Raspberry Pi Camera HQ. But the V2 model is more affordable and works just fine.
