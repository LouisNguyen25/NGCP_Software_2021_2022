Beginning Implentation of Ultrasonic Sensor
	Started following tutorial on basic setup for HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor on Raspberry Pi. 
	Finished script, but unable to complete wiring because I do not have resistors do divide
	output voltage (needed to prevent GPIO pins from frying).
	Will get 330 and 470 ohm resistors by next week.
