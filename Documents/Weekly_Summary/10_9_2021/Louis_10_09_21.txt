Achievements: List your accomplishments during the week, including activities you’ve completed and objective you’ve met.
- Found some sources on how to utilize MATLAB and Simulink in Webots
  -MATLAB .m code files used to run robot controller
  -Simulink as a way to send inputs to the Webot robot

Plans: State your specific, targeted plans for next week. Include due dates.
- Research/Full Tutorial into utilizing MATLAB with Webots

Potential Challenges: Describe any potential obstacles.
- Lack of examples related to Webots and MATLAB
- CS team members have never used MATLAB before (is it worth it to bring to the table?)

Opportunities: Record any lessons you’ve learned and note areas where you can improve.
- The ability to show the graphs outputs on MATLAB is very useful for Webots debugging
- If parameters can be tweaked on the Robot in real time (velocity parameters, PID, etc) then this makes Simulink superior to keyboard inputs to Webots
