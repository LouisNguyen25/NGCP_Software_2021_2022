Webots is an open source and multi-platform desktop application used to simulate robots.
It provides a complete development environment to model, program, and simulate robots.
It supports many langauges (C, C++, Python, MATLAB, etc) and for our purposes, our main interest is in getting the MATLAB portion to work as a means of running Webots through Simulink.
