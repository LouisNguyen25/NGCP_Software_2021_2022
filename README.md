------------------------------

After Component Development
Cameras and Motors/Ultrasonic will join together to develop autonomous system (in Webots and actual hardware)

GPS and IMU/Xbee will join to develop searching algorithms, states of robot, and how to interface with GCS

Controls will work on implementing Simulink development for Simulation and Hardware on ROS network

Controls may also take the opportunity to learn about the other components if they so choose and work with any team
